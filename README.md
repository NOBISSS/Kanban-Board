# 🧩 Kanban Board – Logic Driven Task Management (HTML | CSS | JavaScript)

This project is a **Kanban Board built from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on improving **logic building, UX thinking, and frontend development skills**.

The UI is **custom, dark-themed, smooth and visually impressive**, designed to feel modern and professional — not just a basic college project.

## ✨ Features

| Category | Highlights |
|---------|------------|
| UI / UX | Modern dark theme • Smooth hover & active animations • Toast notifications • Clean modal |
| Logic | State-based task movement rules • Duplicate task validation • Error feedback |
| Interaction | Drag & Drop tasks • Add new tasks • Delete tasks • Realtime count for each column |
| Storage | Automatic save in LocalStorage • Automatic restore on reload |

---

## 🧠 Workflow Logic

Tasks follow a **realistic workflow**, not just free dragging:
To Do → In Progress → Completed


❌ `To Do` → `Completed` directly is **blocked**  
🔔 A **toast message** tells the user why the move is invalid.

This adds **proper logical progression**, like real project management tools.

---

## 🔥 UX Improvements

Users are guided clearly:

- Toast Instructions
- Drag cursor & animations on cards
- Smooth scaling on hover
- Error & duplicate title feedback
- One-click modal to add tasks

The design goal was to make the UI **feel intuitive even for first-time users**.
